        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of North Texas (UNT).
            This program tackles the critical challenges of risk and uncertainty in Generative AI. We develop new algorithms prioritizing privacy, security, explainability, reliability, and robustness to ensure these powerful tools are used responsibly.
			
			Through this immersive experience, we aim to:
			<ul>
				<li>Engage students in innovative, interdisciplinary research on responsible Generative AI.</li>
				<li>Inspire participants to explore how AI can drive social good and encourage graduate studies in Computer Science, Data Science, or Information Science.</li>
				<li>Equip students with the research, communication, and collaboration skills needed to lead the future of responsible AI development.</li>
			</ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Program Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This is a 10-week summer program where selected undergraduate students will work closely with faculty mentors on cutting-edge research projects. Participants will gain technical skills, learn about the research process, and explore potential graduate studies and career paths.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program typically includes weekly seminars, workshops on research ethics and presentation skills, and social activities. The program culminates in a final presentation or poster session.
        </p>
