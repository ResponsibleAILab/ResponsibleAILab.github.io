    <h2>Welcome to the NSF REU Site at UNT!</h2>
    <p>
      The College of Information at the University of North Texas (UNT) will conduct a 10-week summer research program funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for 10 undergraduates from May 19 to July 25, 2025, titled "Beyond Language: Training to Create and Share Vector Embeddings across Applications." The goal of this REU is to teach students how to build modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems capable of communicating acquired knowledge across domains. Knowledge extends beyond what can be described through language, and this program trains students to explore new methods of communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      We welcome rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors from accredited undergraduate institutions who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents to apply for this NSF REU program to conduct research with faculty members at UNT. Underrepresented groups, as well as students from institutions with limited research opportunities, are strongly encouraged to apply. The application deadline is Friday, March 21st.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students participating in this interdisciplinary undergraduate research experience will be trained in techniques that allow them to more efficiently communicate the knowledge acquired by self-supervised deep learning models. The 10 participating students will create vector representations of common terms or items across various applications, apply those embeddings to improve predictive models, and properly validate and document their findings.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first 5 weeks, students will be exposed to different embedding strategies and machine learning applications utilizing embeddings, then transition to demonstrations and troubleshooting of their individual research efforts in the last 5 weeks. Early in the program, participants will identify an embedding, application domain, and external advisor to work with among a number of presented options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will also engage in UNT's long-standing, unique AI/CS summer research program, which integrates current UNT students and external REU students to facilitate collaboration across departments and collaboration among a range of students and faculty mentors.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are grateful for the support provided by the NSF, the College of Information, the Department of Information Science, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and other offices at UNT for making this program possible.
